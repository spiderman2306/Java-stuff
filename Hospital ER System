**Hospital Emergency Room System (Java)**

This project is a Java implementation of a **Hospital Emergency Room System** designed to demonstrate the practical use of **custom data structures**. The system simulates real-world hospital operations using a **queue** and a **stack**, both implemented manually with **linked lists** (without relying on Java’s built-in Stack or Queue classes).

#### 🔹 Key Features

* **Queue-based patient management**

  * Patients are admitted in arrival order
  * Emergency patients are prioritized ahead of normal patients
* **Stack-based undo functionality**

  * Allows reversal of the most recent treatment to simulate real-life correction of medical decisions
* **Custom data structures**

  * `QueueAsMyLinkedList` for patient flow
  * `StackAsMyLinkedList` for undo operations
* Fully tested using a dedicated test class

#### 🔹 Functionalities Implemented

* Admit normal and emergency patients
* Treat patients in correct priority order
* Undo the most recent treatment
* Handle edge cases (e.g. treating when the queue is empty)
* Display current system status (queue and stack)

#### 🔹 Purpose

This assignment was completed as part of a **Computer Science Data Structures module** to reinforce understanding of **linked lists, stacks, queues, and real-world problem modeling** using Java.

📂 **Technologies:** Java
📚 **Concepts:** Linked Lists, Stack, Queue, Priority Handling, Object-Oriented Design
